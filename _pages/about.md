I'm Paul Reeves, aka Reevo, a freelance web developer and musician.

I am proud to have worked at Senior, Lead, and Technical Director level for the likes of Ginger Media Group, Time Inc. and Viacom, building the online presence for brands such as <a href="https://www.mtv.co.uk/" target="_blank">MTV</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/" target="_blank">NME</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET" target="_blank">BET</a>, <a href="https://www.comedycentral.co.uk/" target="_blank">Comedy Central</a>, <a href="https://www.nick.co.uk/" target="_blank">Nickelodeon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TFI_Friday" target="_blank">TFI Friday</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Channel_(international)" target="_blank">Paramount Channel</a>, <a href="https://www.wallpaper.com/">Wallpaper\*</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Radio#Website_and_internet_broadcasting" target="_blank">Virgin Radio</a>.

My first job in media was in 1998 as a webmaster for Virgin Radio, though I soon moved into web application development. Since joining MTV UK in 2007, I have specialised in full-stack Drupal/PHP development. I also dabble with various JavaScript frameworks, and dip my toe into the world of DevOps from time to time.

I left Viacom/MTV in 2016 to work as a freelance developer so that I could spend more time with my young family, and we relocated from London to a small town in Suffolk in 2019.

As a musician, I mostly play electric, acoustic and bass guitar, though I love tinkering with pretty much any instrument I can get my hands on.
