I'm Paul Reeves, aka Reevo, a freelance web developer and musician.

My first job in media was in 1998 as a webmaster, though I soon moved into web application development. Since 2007, I have specialised as a backend Drupal/PHP developer. I also dabble with various JavaScript frameworks, and dip my toe into the world of DevOps from time to time.

As a musician, I mostly play electric, acoustic and bass guitar, though I love tinkering with pretty much any instrument I can get my hands on.
