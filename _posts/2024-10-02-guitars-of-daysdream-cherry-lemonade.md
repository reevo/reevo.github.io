A new video in Carl's <em>Guitars of Daysdream</em> series. This one was really tight, with only 8 bars to play with and quite a lot going on already, so I didn't really want to introduce something that sounded too different to everything else on the track for such a short space of time.

I think I also sent over some synthy layers to go elsewhere in the track, but can't remember what ended up in the final mix. Maybe I should do a series of <em>Non-guitar Bits of Daysdream</em> videos before I forget too much? :)
