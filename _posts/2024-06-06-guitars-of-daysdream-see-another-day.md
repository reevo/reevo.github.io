Carl from <a href="https://theshopwindow.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">The Shop Window</a> has been running a series of videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvv8lAw1bGNj8ozE4CYOBA" target="_blank">YouTube</a> giving a behind-the-scenes peek at how he builds some of the lush guitar tones on the Daysdream album.

I loved contributing to this album, and I was never quite sure what the brief would be from one track to the next. Carl's an amazing guitarist, so he would often just need something with a different flavour to help balance a track. On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDgE3K02j04" target="_blank">See Another Day</a>, I think he asked for a solo that's "a bit John Squirey" :)

For the guitar nerds: it's played on my beloved 2004 Tokai UES-100 SR, which I've owned since 2005, plugged straight into a Marshall Origin 20. 

As a baby, one of my darling daughters lifted the Tokai's pickguard to see what was underneath and it snapped off in her hands. I played it sans-guard for a while until 2018, when I had <a href="https://drrobertsguitarsurgery.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Robert</a> switch out the stock humbuckers for a set of Lindy Fralin HB-sized P90s. Robbie had a spare Epiphone pickguard lying around his workshop, so on it went.
